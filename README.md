# Description
An ongoing personal project I began last summer. My goal was to design a foundation for a 2D tile-based game. The Engine is not complete or optimized by any means, but it is stable and contains many features that were difficult to implement.
Time commitment ~250 hours
Most of the time was spent bug fixing or researching how to implement features. 
Development of the project went slower than the development of an actual game due to my self-imposed restriction of making all the code easily transferable to another game.
Issues and Hurdles
The most difficulty I had was implementing collision. Even now, the collision system still contains some issues, but it is smooth enough not to stifle movement.
Reflection/Lessons learned
If I were to remake this project, I would likely use a low-impact library such as OpenGL or JBox2D in order to speed up development. I realized that I spent a long time on smaller features simply due to having to "reinvent the wheel" every time I wanted to add a mechanic to my game.
